# RESPONSIVE PAGE - ERROR 404 😵

It's a responsive page that returns 'ERROR 404', 'OBJECT NOT FOUND' and its definition. 📄🤔

I made it only with HTML, CSS and a little bit of media queries ... and too many hours to research how to make it responsive. 🙂💢

In the end, i'm happy with the result. 🙆‍♂️😄
